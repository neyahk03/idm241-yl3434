    <h1>Case Study</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
            This project explores the evaluation, improvement, and expansion of the microinteractions within Crunchyroll's movie tile interface, a crucial component of its user experience. The work was completed as part of IDM 241: Microinteraction Design, under the guidance of Professor Jervis Thompson. Over the course of 10+ weeks, the project followed a structured approach to analyze the existing interaction, improve its usability, and develop a cohesive system of five or more microinteractions to enhance user engagement.

        <h2>Context &amp; challenges</h2>

        <h3>Project Background</h3>
            <p>Crunchyroll is a leading streaming platform for anime, known for its energetic and immersive branding. The movie tile is an essential part of its interface, allowing users to explore and interact with movie content. However, the existing microinteractions lacked engaging feedback, seamless interactivity, and consistency with Crunchyroll's dynamic identity. This project aimed to address these gaps by redesigning the microinteractions to create a more intuitive and delightful user experience.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The existing microinteractions in Crunchyroll's movie tile interface had several issues:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Limited interactivity that hindered user engagement.</li>
                <li>Missed opportunities to align with Crunchyroll's vibrant and energetic brand identity.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            These shortcomings detracted from the overall user experience, making it less engaging and intuitive.

        </p>

        <h3>Goals &amp; Objectives</h3>

        <p>The primary goal of this project was to enhance the user experience of Crunchyroll's movie tile interface by redesigning its microinteractions. Specific objectives included:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analyze Existing Interactions: </strong>Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the current microinteraction to identify improvement areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Functionality: </strong>Redesign the interaction to address usability issues and enhance feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a Microinteraction Ecosystem: </strong>Develop a cohesive system of five or more microinteractions to make the movie tile more dynamic and engaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Document and Evaluate: </strong>Provide a detailed explanation of each microinteraction, including its triggers, rules, feedback, loops, and modes.</li>
            </ul>
