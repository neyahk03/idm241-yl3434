    <h1>Case Study</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
            This project explores the evaluation, improvement, and expansion of the microinteractions within Crunchyroll's movie tile interface, a crucial component of its user experience. The work was completed as part of IDM 241: Microinteraction Design, under the guidance of Professor Jervis Thompson. Over the course of 10+ weeks, the project followed a structured approach to analyze the existing interaction, improve its usability, and develop a cohesive system of five or more microinteractions to enhance user engagement.

</p>

        <h2>Context &amp; challenges</h2>

        <h3>Project Background</h3>
            <p>Crunchyroll is a leading streaming platform for anime, known for its energetic and immersive branding. The movie tile is an essential part of its interface, allowing users to explore and interact with movie content. However, the existing microinteractions lacked engaging feedback, seamless interactivity, and consistency with Crunchyroll's dynamic identity. This project aimed to address these gaps by redesigning the microinteractions to create a more intuitive and delightful user experience.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The existing microinteractions in Crunchyroll's movie tile interface had several issues:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Limited interactivity that hindered user engagement.</li>
                <li>Missed opportunities to align with Crunchyroll's vibrant and energetic brand identity.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            These shortcomings detracted from the overall user experience, making it less engaging and intuitive.

        </p>

        <h3>Goals &amp; Objectives</h3>

        <p>The primary goal of this project was to enhance the user experience of Crunchyroll's movie tile interface by redesigning its microinteractions. Specific objectives included:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analyze Existing Interactions: </strong>Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the current microinteraction to identify improvement areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Functionality: </strong>Redesign the interaction to address usability issues and enhance feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a Microinteraction Ecosystem: </strong>Develop a cohesive system of five or more microinteractions to make the movie tile more dynamic and engaging.</li>
                <li><strong>Document and Evaluate: </strong>Provide a detailed explanation of each microinteraction, including its triggers, rules, feedback, loops, and modes.</li>
            </ul>
        

        <h2>Process &amp; Insight</h2>

            <h3>Alpha</h3>

            <p>
                In the first phase of the project, I focused on analyzing and building the code for the existing microinteraction in Crunchyroll's movie tile interface. The movie tile features a hover effect, which displays basic information when users hover over the tile. Upon clicking the tile, users are redirected to the movie's detailed page. Additionally, users can interact with three buttons at the bottom: Play, Bookmark, and Add to List.
            </p>

            <p>
                The microinteraction, while functional, felt disjointed and lacked smooth transitions. Hovering over the tile didn't provide clear visual feedback, and the button interactions felt abrupt and lacked engaging animations. The navigation transitions, when clicking the tile, also felt slightly disconnected from the overall flow of the interface.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the Alpha Build, I focused on building the original interactions without making any significant changes to their functionality. The goal was to have an exact reproduction of the existing design to better understand its flaws and limitations. By doing so, I could identify the core aspects that needed improvement in the subsequent phases.
            </p>

            <h3>Beta</h3>

            <p>In Phase 2 of the project, I made improvements to the existing microinteractions based on feedback from my professor. The key insight was that these microinteractions should feel seamless and include smooth animations for a more fluid experience. To address this, I reimagined the hover state and introduced a more engaging interaction flow.
            </p>

            <p>For the hover effect, I replaced the static interaction with a flip card animation. When users hover over a movie tile, it expands slightly, creating a more dynamic and interactive experience. This change aimed to make the hover state feel less abrupt and more visually appealing.
            </p>

            <p>Additionally, I changed the click interaction. When the tile is clicked, it flips 180 degrees, revealing detailed information about the movie on the back of the card. This flip animation adds depth and interactivity, making the transition from the front to the back of the tile more engaging.

            </p>

            <p>For the three buttons (Play, Bookmark, Add to List) at the bottom, I added an animation. When users hover over each button, it increases by 30%. This subtle improvement provides visual feedback, making the buttons feel more interactive and consistent with the new hover and click animations.
            </p>

            <h3>Final</h3>

            <p>In the final phase, I expanded the movie tile microinteraction system to meet the requirement of five or more interactions. Based on feedback from my professor and peers, I added enhancements to improve user engagement and overall fluidity. These updates included refining button interactions and introducing a modal box for the "Add to List" button. The final build resulted in a more cohesive and dynamic user experience, successfully meeting the project requirements while enhancing the user journey.
            </p>



        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <p>After analyzing and developing the microinteractions for the movie tile, I implemented the following solutions to enhance the user experience:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Movie Tile (Default &amp; Active): </strong>On hover, the tile increases in size by 30%. When clicked, it flips 180 degrees to reveal more movie details.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Play Button: </strong>On hover, the button increases by 30%. After clicking, a star falling animation plays for 2 seconds, then opens the first episode in the browser.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Bookmark Button (Default &amp; Active):</strong>On hover, the button increases by 30%, returning to normal size when hover ends. The size changes when the mouse is pressed, and the background fills on release. In the active state, clicking again removes the filled background.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Add To List Button: </strong>Similar hover effects as the Play and Bookmark buttons. When clicked, a modal box fades in, allowing the user to add the movie to their preferred list.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Close Button (in Model Box): </strong>Same hover effects as the other buttons. When clicked, the modal box fades out.
            </li>

        </ol>

        <p>While developing these microinteractions, I made sure they aligned with Crunchyroll's branding and focused on enhancing the user experience without creating a cluttered design. The goal was to improve interactivity and engagement while maintaining a clean, easy-to-navigate interface.
        </p>

        <h2>The Results</h2>
        <p>The project was a success in achieving its primary objectives, which were to enhance the user experience of the movie tile on Crunchyroll by designing engaging microinteractions while maintaining brand consistency and ease of navigation. The key success factors include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved User Engagement: </strong>The animations and interactive elements contributed to a more dynamic and responsive interface</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Usability: </strong>The clear, intuitive microinteractions made it easier for users to navigate the platform and interact with the movie tile and buttons, improving overall usability.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>While I did not collect quantitative data directly, qualitative feedback from peers and instructors indicated that the interactions made the platform feel smoother and more immersive. Feedback also highlighted that the updated design felt intuitive and aligned with Crunchyroll's branding.
